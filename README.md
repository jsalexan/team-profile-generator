  ## Description
  This application assists the user in creating a document with profiles of all their team members. It allows you to include information specific to the employee's role and to see that info printed to the page in the form of cards. 
  <br>

  For my application, I used the following technologies: NodeJS, Inquirer, Jest, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML.
  <br><br>
  There were a few challenges in creating this application. The assignment required tests to be written, which is new and it is challenging getting them to run correctly. It was also a bit tricky getting the user information to render into separate cards. Then the assignment itself was quite complex to coordinate, with all the various moving pieces.
  <br><br>
  I am looking forward to finishing the tests and upgrading the CSS for the cards. I think it would be fun to have the employees also submit a picture. Maybe the ID could be autogenerated. I would also like to add more checks to the prompts.

  ## [Tests](#table-of-contents)
  There are several tests created to proof the methods created for each Employee class. For example, this one checks to be sure the Employee was created with the correct information: 
  ![Tests](./src/images/tests.png)
  The tests can be found in the tests folder. To run them, open an integrated terminal and type "npm test". The results can be seen in this screenshot. Also, be sure you have Jest installed.
